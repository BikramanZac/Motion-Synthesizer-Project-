<b> The Motion Syntesizer's final model is shown below in the picture. Our device allows user to control various musical effects by tracking objects, by hand movements in front of the sensors, and by body movements in front of a screen. As shown in the picture here, it has different pushbuttons to give a wide range of functionality and features to the user. We have a GUI that displays different screens and guides the user thru every mode.
