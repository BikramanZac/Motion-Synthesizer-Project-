This document is to describe you about different files and folders.

There is a separate folder for all the source code files which are actually python scripts.

But our full project containing all the files mixed, is in the System Control folder. This folder has all the scripts, images, screens displayed on the GUI
and musical notes we used in the project. If you want to get that full directory, that's our whole project with every file.

But for easy access and separation, we have all the scripts in the Source files folder as well. 

All of the documents are contained in the Documentation folder.
